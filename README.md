# Daisy3D
a try to get into modern OpenGL using GLAD and SDL2


## on mac just run :`make`
dont forget to make the Bin Folder ;)

## on windows and etc you should have sdl2.dll on Libs Folder (also remove the libsdl.dylib file : its for mac only) and you should change the makefile a little bit and then  : `make`
